# Uber-Donate-iPhone-App

## Inspiration
Small amounts of donations can make big differences especially when we're talking about an app like uber with 8 million users around the globe.

## What it does
It allows you to specify your pick up and drop off location and gives you a price estimate. The price estimate is rounded off to provide a small donation amount in cents. This donation can also be posted on Facebook to encourage others. The uber button can be clicked to open the app on uber.

## How I built it
We used the Uber Rides pod, and the rides rest API to get data from Uber. We used AFN Networking to make an HTTP request. We used social to allow Facebook sharing and map kit to display locations. It was coded in Xcode and Swift and simulated on an iPhone running iOS 10.

## Challenges I ran into
Creating the App Icon and working with the Uber Rest API in swift since there was no direct documentation provided. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Coming up with a realistic idea and getting the app to work seamlessly and efficiently along with the website, which is part 2 of this submission. Creating a good and easy UI. And building the entire app from scratch.

## What I learned
We learnt how to use the Uber API and rides rest API as well as social for Facebook sharing. We also learnt html and javascript to build the website 

## What's next for UberDonation App 
Contacting Uber to provide the concept and see if it's feasible to implement the UI
